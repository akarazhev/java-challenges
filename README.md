# Java Challenges

## Two Pointers & Co.

This module groups together three of the most common patterns that may be used to solve problems where the input data 
is linear: Two Pointers, Fast and Slow Pointers, and Modified Binary Search. Both the Two Pointers and the Modified 
Binary Search patterns derive their power from their ability to efficiently reduce the size of the search space, that is, 
both exemplify the divide-and-conquer approach to problem-solving. The Fast and Slow Pointers pattern may be considered 
a variant of the Two Pointers pattern, where the two pointers move at different speeds in order to traverse the input 
list in a way that solves the given problem. After completing this module, we will have learned how to use this set of 
related patterns to solve a diverse range of problems.

**Objectives**:
- Hands-on experience with using the Two Pointers pattern
- A working knowledge of the Fast and Slow Pointers pattern
- Hands-on experience with using the Modified Binary Search pattern
- The ability to choose the most appropriate of these three patterns to solve a new problem
