# Check Permutation

## Statement

Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other.

### Hints

- Describe what it means for two strings to be permutations of each other. Now, look at that definition you provided. 
Can you check the strings against that definition?
- There is one solution that is 0(N log N) time. Another solution uses some space, but is O(N) time.
- Could a hash table be useful?
- Two strings that are permutations should have the same characters, but in different orders. Can you make the orders the same?

### Solution

Solutions are here:
[CheckPermutation.java](../../../src/main/java/com/github/akarazhev/challenge/interview/arraysandstrings/CheckPermutation.java 
"CheckPermutation.java").
