# Palindrome Permutation

## Statement

Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that 
is the same forwards and backwards. A permutation is a rearrangement of letters. The palindrome does not need to be 
limited to just dictionary words.

### Hints

- You do not have to-and should not-generate all permutations. This would be very inefficient.
- What characteristics would a string that is a permutation of a palindrome have?
- Have you tried a hash table? You should be able to get this down to 0(N) time.
- Can you reduce the space usage by using a bit vector?
