# URLify

## Statement

Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the 
end to hold the additional characters,and that you are given the "true" length of the string. 
(Note: If implementing in Java, please use a character array so that you can perform this operation in place.)

### Hints

- It's often easiest to modify strings by going from the end of the string to the beginning.
- You might find you need to know the number of spaces. Can you just count them?
